# Gene-Therapy
notes and other details about my project on Gene Therapy with Dr. Byrne.

# Introduction

In this project, I have to analyze scRNAseq data, and find out the presence of AAV barcodes in them and also perform celltype identification of the sequenced cells.

# Data
The intial data I am working on (I am trying to reproduce the results of the paper initially) can be found here: https://0-www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.brum.beds.ac.uk/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE161645
