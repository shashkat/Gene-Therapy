- Ask about the data, when, why (purpose/overall-experiment), animal?
- Used kallisto for initial cell-gene matrix expression estimation
- Assuming mouse species (dont know right now!)
- which out of these techs? I am assuming 10xv2 rn
10XV1
10XV2
10XV3
10XV3_ULTIMA

- dont have rights to create conda env in CRC (thought of creating new env to work)
- where is the aav barcodes file?
- around 650 cells when aligning with mouse genome but only 150 when aligning with human. So probably a mouse sample.
- show the qc results for the cells (aligned to mouse). Dont knwo  

Meeting on 02-21-24

- Regarding the number of cells found in the previous files (for which i had sent mail to ali and leah.)
- also how the files were? the fastqc files.
- need image files for the other samples too?
- figuring out the AAV scripts
- ask about the read1 and read2 configuration (even in the fastq results last time, the length og the reads in either of the files was not the same). I dont understand it very well.
- in the process of extracting barcodes info.
- also new files also mouse?
- i submitted job, how to know status
- confirm with aman, if the way i ran the job is right (and that i ran it from the /ocean directory. that shouldn't be a problem imo, but just in case).
